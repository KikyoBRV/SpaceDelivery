# SpaceDelivery

  SpaceDelivery is a game inspired by the "snake game," but I have modified and added some rules. In this game, players control a spaceship that must collect parcels and deliver them to designated delivery points. Players earn bonus points based on the number of parcels the spaceship is carrying. Each time a player delivers parcels to a delivery point, the spaceship's speed increases, making the game more challenging and requiring players to strategize before delivering parcels.

  This is my Computer Programming 1 project (done since my first year of undergraduate studies, first semester). Therefore, this project is considered my first attempt at making a game using Python.
